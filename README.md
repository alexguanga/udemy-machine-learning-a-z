About:

Machine Learning has been regarded as promising career path. As a Economics majors with minors in CS and Mathematics, I have enjoyed Machine Learning and Data Science. As a self-taught student, I have taken numerous courses in Udemy, Coursera, and EDX.

Honestly, the intuition was the best component of the course. The code in Python and R was okay. I wish it would have more complicated and practical datasets. Also, I would have appreciated if there were more projects/homework. I think it would have solidified a lot of the material.
