    "    - Step 1: Make a data point a single-point clusters - that forms N clusters\n",
    "    - Step 2: Take the two closest data points and make them one cluster - that forms N - 1 clusters\n",
    "    - Step 3: Take the two closest clusters and make them one cluster - that forms N - 2 clusters\n",
    "    - Step 4: Repeat until there is one cluster\n",
    "- Measuring the distance btw. two points can be straightforward. However, measuring the distance between two clusters can be a bit more different!\n",
    "- How to measure the distance btw both clusters?\n",
    "    - Option 1: Distance btw the closest points\n",
    "    - Option 2: Distance btw the further points\n",
    "    - Option 3: Average distance btw all the possibilties\n",
    "    - Option 4: Distance btw the centroids\n",
    "- Why don't you combine all the points to one clusters? Apparently, the process of combining the clusters has use!"
